## 📦 Features

- Select a customer from real data  
- View behavioral summary  
- Get top-N recommended categories  
- Powered by PyTorch and Streamlit

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HRChiam/purchase-prediction-streamlit.git
cd purchase-prediction-streamlit
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

## 📂 Dataset

* **Source**: Public Kaggle dataset
* **Auto-download** in code:

```python
!gdown --id 1XeVEFe9rW2KwWfVmMqVbR78quzKZlHrw --output Online_Shopping_Data.csv
```

* If this fails, you may manually download and place the file in the `data/` directory.

---

## 🧠 Model Details

* **Model**: Contrastive learning with PyTorch
* **Embedding**: Sentence-BERT (SBERT)
* **Fixed seeds for reproducibility**:

```python
import torch, numpy as np, random
torch.manual_seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)
random.seed(42)
```

### 📦 Artifacts

* `contrastive_model.pt` – Saved trained model
* `user_embeddings.pkl`, `category_embeddings.pkl` – Precomputed vector files

---

## 🧪 Reproducibility

* All steps are reproducible via:

  * `PROCESS.md` instructions
  * `run_all.ipynb` or `main.py` (if available)

### 🔖 Git Version Tags

* `v1.0`: Initial model
* `v1.1`: Deployed version
